Magic: The Gathering® is a cardgame where you are a powerful wizard (planewalker) battling other powerful wizards (planewalkers) by casting spells using the mana drawn from the world around you, with the main goal of reducing your opponent to **0** health.

## Colors of Magic

In Magic there are five colors, White, Blue, Black, Red and Green. Each color represents a set of beliefs and principles. A color's philosophy explains how it sees the world, what objectives it hopes to realize, and what resources and tactics a color has at its disposal, and ties into its strengths, weaknesses and unique mechanics.

You can combine different colors to either further enhance their strengths or cover up for a colors inherit weakness, at the cost of having to manage your mana. Different combinations of colors unlock different archetypes and ways to play.
## How to Read a Magic Card

> [!Warning]
> The terms and wording in Magic: The Gathering® is very particular and literal, so try not to rely on 'common sense' when interpreting card text, as this might make interactions between keywords confusing. For instance, *Sacrifice* and *Destroy* are not the same, even though the end result is the creature *Die* (is put into a graveyard from the battlefield), but bright side is this can be used to your **advantage**.
### Card Anatomy
The most relevant pieces of information on a magic card is its **Name**, **Mana Cost**, **Type Line**, **Text Box**, and **Power/Toughness**. A creature card might look something like this:

![|300](https://tcgplayer-cdn.tcgplayer.com/product/587990_in_1000x1000.jpg)

#### **Name and Mana Cost:**
![[Example, nameline.png]]
Firstly, the text to the left represents the cards name and mostly exists for flavor, but is helpful for quickly identifying cards (duh) when they are being played, and for specific instances when another card requires a card to be named. 

To the right is the cards mana cost, a set of numbers and symbols used to represent the the type and total amount of mana needed to cast a spell. To calculate the mana value of a card, just add all the symbols together. 

>[!Example]
> For Captain America, First Avenger you pay 1 White {W}, 1 Blue {U} and 1 Red {R}, for a total of 3 mana to cast the spell.

In addition to the colored mana {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} (also known as pips), you might see gray symbols {X} (casters choice), {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, etc. These represent a generic cost, and can be paid for using any colored mana (even colorless). 

>[!Example]
 >A card with {3}{W}{W} would cost 3 generic mana and 2 white mana, for a total of 5 mana.

#### **Type Line**
![[Example, typeline.png]]
The type line is where you see what type the spell belongs to. Look at the section on card types for more information.

>[!Example]
>Captain America, First Avenger has the supertype Legendary, the type Creature and the subtypes Human, Soldier and Hero. Any effect that would effect any of these types would effect him.

#### **Text Box**
![[Example, textbox.png]]
A cards text box is arguably the most important part of a card, describing exactly what the card does. This is most often Keywords, Activated Abilities, Triggered Abilities and Replacement Effects. The Keywords are a shorthand for different effects that change how a creature works, often overwriting rules. Some of the most common are Deathtouch, First Strike, Haste, Lifelink, Flying, Reach and Trample (described in the keywords chapter).

Activated Abilities are indicated with a cost and effect, always written on the format [Cost] : [Effect]. Everything before the colon is the cost being paid, and everything after the colon is the effect. 

>[!Example]
> This card has the activated ability "*Throw ...*", where the **cost** is paying 3 generic mana and unattatching an Equipment from him and the **effect** is him dealing damage equal to the Equipment mana value to 1, 2 or 3 targets. 

Triggered Abilities are indicated with the words "When", "Whenever" or "At" and grant some effect when the specified trigger happens.

>[!Example]
> This card also has the triggered ability "... Catch" that says at in the beginning of combat step, you attach one of your Equipment to Captain America.

Replacement Effects are indicated with the word "If" and change or modify things that *would* happen.

Just remember:

**Power/Toughness**
![[Example, creaturestats.png]]
Creatures also have a Power/Toughness value that shows how much damage they deal in combat, and how much damage they can take before they are destroyed. 

### Card Types

Magic: The Gathering® differentiate cards by card type. The most general of these are spells and land, with the most important difference being land cards will give you mana so you can cast your spell cards.

Another category of cards are permanents and non-permanents, where permanents are the cards that stay around on the battlefield while non-permanents are cards that have some one-and-done effect.

Your spells can also be divided into different types, each representing a different tool in a wizards arsenal, these types can also be divided into sub-types. Important to note that a card *can* have more than one type. 

Permanents:
- Creatures: These are your minions you summon to fight for you on the battlefield, useful either for their stats or effects.
	- Subtypes for creatures include different categories like Human, Soldier, Beast, Zombie, etc... 
- Enchantments: Persistent magical effects that remain on the battlefield, granting some continuous effect.
	- Aura:  An enchantment that only effects one permanent.
	- Saga:  An enchantment that goes through a series of effects before disappearing, represents a story being told.  
- Artifacts: Some physical magical item like generally requires some interaction to use, like equipment or devices.
	- Equipment: magical items used by creatures to give them abilities or effects.
	- Vehicle: magical objects/structures requiring creatures to operate.
- Planewalkers: An ally with a set of powerful abilities, who will fight along side you.
- Token: A type of permanent that is not represented by a regular card, created from a spell or ability, and can only exist on the battlefield. A token can represent any of the other types, so a Token Creature will usually have a creature subtype. Some of the most common Token Artifacts  subtypes are Treasure, Clue, Food and Blood.

Non-Permanents:
- Instants and Sorceries: Your typical wizard "spell" spell, which give you some instantaneous effect. Instants are quick spells that can be used often, while Sorceries are more powerful, but can only be cast on your turn.

In addition to subtypes, a card can also have a Legendary supertype, which means they are bound to the legend rule, which prevents multiple copies of the cards with the same name from existing on the battlefield under the same player's control. 
## The Board

A game of Magic normally consists of **seven** different *zones*:
- library: all your cards.
- hand: the cards you can currently play*.
- battlefield: all permanents you play go here.
- graveyard: all permanents that are destroyed or sacrificed go here, a long with any instant or sorcery you cast. 
- stack: very important for later, all ***spells*** and abilities go here before they resolve. 
- exile: cards that are removed from the game.
- command: a zone for commanders not currently on the battlefield.

Each player has their own library, hand and graveyard, while the other zones are shared between players.

Only your hand and library are hidden zones, meaning not all players are expected to see the cards. The zones are public.

## On Your Turn

The game itself is played in turns, with each turn having a set of phases you will have to go through in order. This is where you do most of your game actions, like summon your creatures, cast your sorceries and attack other players.

Without making things too confusing, on your turn you are considered the *Active Player*, but you are only allowed to take actions when you *Priority*. Thankfully, the Active Player always gets priority at the start of phases and steps. However at the end of steps and phases, the *Priority* passes to the non-Active Player in turn order, allowing them to respond and play certain cards or activate abilities during your turn.

**Beginning Phase**

- Untap step
- Upkeep step
- Draw step

At the start of your turn, you *untap*\* all your cards, resolve all your *upkeep* triggers if you have any and then *draw* a card from your library.

> [!info]
>In Magic, we tap a card to indicate that a resource cannot be used again until your next turn. Cards normally become tapped as a cost for using it's ability or by declaring it as an attacker. 

**Pre-Combat Main Phase**

In either of your main phases you are allowed to play your land for turn (once per turn, you're allowed to simply place a land from your hand onto the battlefield), cast spells* or use abilities of permanents already on the battlefield. When you are finished with your first main phase, you simply declare that you are moving to combat (this is often implicit).

> To cast a spell you both need the spell itself and the mana required to cast it, you can cast as many spells as you want any time you have the ability to do so, granted you have the mana for them. The same is true for any ability you wish to activate.

> Special Note: Summoned creatures have "summoning sickness" which means they cannot attack or use activated abilities with the {tap} or {untap} symbol. 

>[!info]- Haste
>A creature with the keyword *"Haste"* can circumvent the summoning sickness rule, allowing it to attack and tap the same turn it comes down.

**Combat**
- Beginning of combat step
- Declare Attackers step
- Declare Blockers step
- First Strike* Damage step
- Damage step
- End of Combat step

After moving to combat, the we first resolve any *beginning of combat* triggers you may have, similar to the upkeep step. 

You then declare attackers by deciding which creature will attack this combat by tapping them. Only other players and planewalkers are legal targets for attacking creatures. 

After declaring attackers, the opponent(s) who have been attacked gets to declare their blockers, choosing which of their creatures will block yours. If an attacking creature is blocked, it will deal its damage to the blocking creature instead of the player, even if blocking creatures ceases to exit. A defending player can assign any number of creatures to block an attacking creature. 

In the Damage Step, creatures deal their damage at the same time and any creatures that got destroyed are removed from play. If an attacking creature is blocked by multiple defenders, the attacker spreads out the damage as they wish. 

In the end of combat step we resolve any *at end of combat* triggers, and it's the last chance to take actions inside combat, and we start cleaning up "end of combat" effects. 

> [!info]- Vigilance
> Creatures with the keyword "*Vigilance*" can attack without tapping, allowing you to both attack, and subsequently block with the same creature on the following turns.

> [!info]- Trample
> Creatures with the keyword "Trample" deals excess damage to the blocking creatures controller. Creatures must be dealt lethal damage for it to trample over.

>[!info]- First Strike and Double Strike
> Creatures with the keyword "*First Strike*" or "*Double Strike*" deal damage their damage in an additional damage step before the normal one. Double Strikers gets to deal damage twice.


**Post-Combat Main Phase**
Identical to the Pre-Combat Main Phase, if you haven't played your land yet you can do so now. 

>[!tip] 
>  It is often beneficial to wait to summon creatures you don't need or cant use at the start of combat here, as it allows you to have *mana open*\* during the combat phase. Even if you don't have any *combat tricks*\* in your hand, simply having a card in hand and mana available is enough to make your opponent think, and may affect how they respond.

**Ending Phase**
- End step
- Cleanup step

The end step is the last chance to play instant speed spells and effects before the turn ends. 

In the cleanup step you check for effects that say "end of turn" and remove them, discard down to hand size (7 cards) and remove all damage from creatures.
